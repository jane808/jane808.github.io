## Why Coding Standards Really Matter
Before taking this software engineering course, I used to think coding standards were mostly about picky style rules—like where to put braces or how many spaces to indent. But after just a week of working with ESLint in VSCode, I’ve realized they play a much bigger role in writing good code.
At first, ESLint felt frustrating. It kept flagging little things I wouldn’t have thought twice about—missing semicolons, unused variables, inconsistent formatting. But as I fixed each issue, I started to see the value. These “small” corrections added up to cleaner, more reliable code. I was also learning best practices I hadn’t been taught directly—like using const instead of let or being consistent with return types.
More importantly, coding standards helped me see how important consistency is, especially when working in a team. When everyone writes code the same way, it’s easier to read, debug, and improve. It also saves time during code reviews because we don’t have to argue over formatting—we can focus on what the code actually does.
Now, instead of seeing ESLint as a chore, I see it as a helpful guide. It’s pushed me to write better code and think more like a professional developer. If I had to pick one habit to improve code quality, it would be following coding standards—because they teach you to care not just about whether your code works, but how well it fits into the bigger picture.
