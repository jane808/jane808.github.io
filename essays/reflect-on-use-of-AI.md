## How AI Became My Constant Companion in ICS 314  

### Introduction  
Artificial Intelligence has completely changed how I learn, and nowhere was that more obvious than in ICS 314. While some students might see AI as a “backup plan,” I saw it as a partner. Whether it was ChatGPT, Bard, or GitHub Copilot, I used AI in almost every part of this course. At first, I felt like I might be “cheating” myself out of the experience, but the more I worked with these tools, the more I realized that AI was pushing me further, faster, and with more confidence than I would have had on my own.  

### Personal Experience with AI  

1. **Experience WODs (e.g., E18)**  
   I leaned on AI from the very beginning. For the functional programming WOD, I asked ChatGPT: *“Write a function using underscore to implement the following instructions …”*. The answer wasn’t always perfect, but it gave me a launchpad. Instead of staring at a blank screen, I had something to refine. That confidence boost was priceless.  

2. **In-class Practice WODs**  
   Even though the idea was to practice with classmates, I still used AI outside of class to prep. I’d ask it: *“Explain why this solution is more efficient than what I had.”* By the time I sat down in class, I had already walked through the concepts with AI as my tutor.  

3. **In-class WODs**
   Unlike most classes where you’d be on your own during timed assessments, ICS 314 actually allowed us to use AI during in-class WODs. Honestly, this was a game-changer for me. If I hit a roadblock, I could just ask ChatGPT: *“Why is my function returning undefined?”* or *“Fix the ESLint errors in this code.”* Instead of freezing under pressure, I kept moving. It didn’t mean the WODs were easy—I still had to understand enough to guide the AI and adapt its answers—but it made the experience way less stressful and a lot more productive. It felt like taking a test with a tutor sitting next to me.

5. **Essays**  
   Every essay I wrote started with ChatGPT and ended with Grammarly. I’d brainstorm prompts like: *“Write me a reflection on TypeScript as if I were a second-year computer science student who’s still learning.”* From there, I’d edit and add my personal voice. Then just run it through Grammarly to polish up everything. The combination of AI structure and my experience made writing way less stressful and actually enjoyable.  

6. **Final Project**  
   My group constantly asked AI for help. Setting up Supabase and Prisma? AI gave us starter code. Debugging errors in Next.js routes? AI explained what the stack traces meant. Even styling our pages went faster with Copilot suggesting Bootstrap classes as we typed. AI felt like the fifth member of our group — always available, always brainstorming.  

7. **Learning a Concept / Tutorial**  
   This was probably my favorite use case. When TypeScript was introduced, I didn’t just read the docs—I asked ChatGPT: *“Pretend I’m a 10-year-old. Explain why TypeScript is stricter than JavaScript with an example.”* The explanation stuck with me better than any tutorial I’d seen.  

8. **Answering a Question in Class or in Discord**  
   If I wasn’t sure about something, I’d run it through AI before asking publicly. I used it as a chance to find answers on my own. I’d ask: *“Does this explanation of Issue Driven Project Management make sense?”* and polish it before posting. That gave me confidence to actually participate more.  

9. **Asking or Answering a Smart Question**  
   Here too, AI was my practice partner. I’d draft a StackOverflow-style question and paste it into ChatGPT: *“Is this a smart question based on Eric Raymond’s essay? How could I make it better?”* It was like getting coached on how to communicate more effectively.  

10. **Coding Example (e.g., Underscore .pluck)**  
   This was where AI felt magical. *“Give me an example of using Underscore .pluck.”* Done. Instant working example, ready to go.  

11. **Explaining Code**  
   When I didn’t understand a snippet, I’d just ask ChatGPT: *“Explain this line by line.”* It was like having a TA sitting next to me, with infinite patience.  

12. **Writing Code**  
   GitHub Copilot became a natural extension of my coding. It predicted function stubs, loop patterns, even small database queries. It didn’t always nail it, but it kept me moving forward.  

13. **Documenting Code**  
   Documentation became way faster with AI. I’d prompt: *“Write a concise JSDoc for this function that fetches event data from Supabase.”* The result wasn’t just accurate—it also reminded me to keep up with good habits.  

14. **Quality Assurance**  
   Debugging with AI was one of the most satisfying uses. *“What’s wrong with this code?”* or *“Fix the ESLint errors in …”* saved me hours of frustration. Even when the fixes weren’t perfect, they gave me a direction, which is often the hardest part.  

15. **Other Uses**  
   I even asked AI for motivational pep talks before hard WODs: *“Convince me I can finish this practice in under 40 minutes.”* Silly, maybe—but it worked.  

### Impact on Learning and Understanding  
Using AI for everything didn’t make me lazy — it made me braver. Instead of worrying about whether I could figure something out, I jumped in knowing I always had backup. That safety net actually helped me take more risks and try harder problems. I don’t think I just learned faster—I learned deeper, because I could keep asking “why” until I understood.  

### Practical Applications Outside ICS 314  
Outside the course, I’ve started using AI in personal projects, like building small React apps or experimenting with APIs. It’s like having a senior engineer pair-programming with me. It makes side projects less intimidating and more fun.  

### Challenges and Opportunities  
The main challenge was knowing when to stop relying on AI and trust myself. Sometimes it gave me an answer so quickly that I didn’t think deeply enough about the problem. But that’s also the opportunity: if I can learn to balance AI with my own reasoning, I’ll be twice as effective.  

### Comparative Analysis  
The course material on the website gave me the foundation, but AI gave me momentum. Lectures and WODs built the core skills, while AI filled in gaps and gave me instant feedback. The combination felt unbeatable with structured practice plus on-demand tutoring.  

### Future Considerations  
I think the future of software engineering education will be AI-driven. Imagine courses where AI isn’t just a side tool, but an integrated teaching assistant built into the curriculum. I’d love to see assignments designed with AI in mind, where part of the lesson is learning how to collaborate with it effectively.  

### Conclusion  
AI wasn’t just something I used in ICS 314 — it became part of how I thought about software engineering. It made me faster, more confident, and more willing to experiment. If anything, I don’t think I would have enjoyed the class as much without it. For me, AI wasn’t just helpful, it was essential.
