## What I Learned About Software Engineering
Looking back, I can see that what I learned went far beyond how to structure a Next.js app or how to style a page with Bootstrap. This class introduced me to key concepts in software engineering that apply to almost any kind of project—whether it's a web app, a mobile app, or something completely different. Three ideas in particular stood out to me: Project Management, Configuration Management, and Open Source Development. These weren’t just useful for getting through the semester — they’re ways of thinking that I could see myself using long after this course is over.

## Agile Project Management Helped Me Stay Focused (Even When Things Felt Messy)
One of the first things I learned how to be a part of and manage a group. At first, I wasn’t totally sure what that meant. But as we started working in teams, it became clear that this lesson wasn’t just about planning — it was about staying sane.

We worked with the idea of breaking a project into small, manageable chunks. every task gets turned into a GitHub issue, with a clear title, description, and checklist. You don’t just start coding — you pick an issue, assign it to yourself, and work from there. It’s simple, but incredibly effective.

What I appreciated most about this method is how well it scaled with the project. Whether we were setting up a landing page or building out a more complex feature, everything felt trackable. There was always a single source of truth for what needed to be done and who was doing it. I could absolutely see myself using this system again—maybe for a group research paper, or even planning a club event. It’s a lightweight way to keep people organized and reduce confusion, which is something every team project could use.

## Why Configuration Management Matters
Another concept that was completely new to me this semester was Configuration Management. That might sound like something only big tech companies care about, but once we started using it, I saw how important it is, especially when multiple people are working on the same project.

In simple terms, configuration management is about keeping track of all the files, settings, and changes that go into building and running a piece of software. Tools like GitHub Desktop are a big part of this. If something breaks, you can look back at your commit history to figure out what changed and when. If two people are editing the same file, we learn how to resolve those conflicts. But it goes beyond version control. It’s also about making sure your project runs the same way on everyone’s computer. Using tools like environment variables and dependency managers helped us avoid the classic “it works on my machine” problem.

This approach is something I’d definitely want to bring into future projects. Even if I’m just writing a script or working on a solo assignment, keeping things organized and reproducible makes a huge difference. It means less stress when something breaks, and less time wasted trying to remember what you changed last.

## Open Source Development Changed the Way I Write Code
Before this class, I thought open source software was something only experienced developers contributed to. I imagined massive GitHub repos with thousands of contributors and super complex code. What I didn’t realize is that any project can be open source—and that working in the open is really just about being clear, collaborative, and intentional with your work.

Throughout the course, we treated our projects like real open source software. We documented our issues, wrote helpful commit messages, and even tried to make our code readable for people who might pick it up after us. That experience changed how I think about writing code. Instead of just doing the minimum to get something working, I started thinking more about future developers (including future me). Would someone be able to understand this file name? Is this function name too vague? Is the README actually useful?

These questions made my code better—not just technically, but as a product someone else might actually use or build on. That mindset is something I want to keep, no matter what kind of software I’m working on.

## Final Thoughts
Even though I came into this class expecting to learn web development, I left with something much more valuable: a set of tools and habits that apply to software engineering as a whole. Agile Project Management helped me understand how to stay organized in a fast-moving project. Configuration Management showed me the importance of keeping things consistent and traceable. And Open Source Development taught me how to code with clarity and purpose.

I still have a lot to learn, but I can already see how these ideas will shape the way I approach projects going forward. Whether I’m working on a website, a research tool, or something completely unexpected, I’ll be better prepared. Not just to build something, but to build it well.
